## Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vihan Perera currently reading for my Master's at [University of Westminster](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/) : )

Hello, and thank you for dropping by! Iâ€™m a digital craftsman whose passion lies in the convergence of technology and artistry, exploring the vast landscape where creativity meets code. My journey is one of constant learning, experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in the digital realm.

**[Creative Front-End Development]** is my playground, where I harness the power of WebGL libraries such as Three.js, Cables.gl, and Spline to create visually stunning and immersive web experiences. My aim is to push the limits of web aesthetics, blending interactivity with beauty.

Diving deeper into **Full Stack Development**, I am committed to architecting robust applications from the ground up. My approach integrates sleek, efficient backend solutions with captivating front-end designs, ensuring a seamless and holistic user experience.

My love for **Minimalistic Web-Based UI Designs** is rooted in UCD (User-Centered Design) principles. I strive to craft interfaces that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also intuitive and user-friendly, embodying the essence of minimalism and functionality.

**Spatial Computing Projects** with a focus on WebXR are where I explore new dimensions of user interaction. I am fascinated by the potential of virtual and augmented realities to redefine our digital experiences, making them more engaging and lifelike.

The intriguing world of **Computational Neuroscience and BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) Projects** is where I indulge my curiosity for the human brain. Through research and experiments, I aim to bridge the gap between neuroscience and technology, exploring innovative ways to integrate brain activity with computing.

At the core of my endeavors are **Interactive Media Projects** that highlight computational arts. These projects are a testament to my belief in the transformative power of combining programming with digital art, creating unique experiences that inspire and provoke thought.

My GitHub is a diary of my explorations and creations at the intersection of art and technology. Each project is a piece of my journey, reflecting my passion for creating meaningful and engaging digital experiences. Join me as I continue to explore, create, and inspire through the magic of code and creativity. Welcome to my world!
