## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vihan Perera : )

As a Front-End Development Enthusiast, I thrive on bringing imaginative ideas to life using cutting-edge WebGL libraries like Three.js, Cables.gl, and Spline. My projects are where art meets technology, aiming to push the boundaries of visual storytelling on the web.

In the realm of Full Stack Development, I enjoy the process of building projects from the ground up, integrating backend logic with front-end flair to create seamless and dynamic user experiences. My goal is always to build applications that are not only functional but also engaging and visually compelling.

My fascination with Spatial Computing leads me to explore WebXR, where I focus on creating immersive virtual and augmented reality experiences. I believe in the power of spatial computing to transform our interactions with the digital world, making them more intuitive and natural.

Computational Neuroscience and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Projects are my playground for research and experiments. I'm captivated by the potential of BCIs to revolutionize our understanding of the human brain and enhance our capabilities through technology.

Overall, my passion lies in Interactive Media Projects, particularly those that highlight computational arts. I'm constantly exploring new ways to combine programming, design, and digital art to create experiences that evoke wonder and inspire curiosity.

Join me on this journey as I continue to explore the fusion of technology and creativity, pushing the envelope of what's possible and always looking forward to the next challenge. Welcome to my GitHub, where each project is a story waiting to be told.
